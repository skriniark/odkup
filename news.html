Scraping gold can be done in many different ways! (And) it's important to choose the best way for you. One method is panning, where you use a shallow pan filled with water and dirt to swirl around and separate the gold from the rest of the material. Another option is sluicing, where you place dirt into a box-like device that has running water at the bottom; this separates heavier materials like gold from lighter ones. You can also use dredging, which involves using a bucket or large tube to suck up sediment from the bottom of rivers and streams to find any pieces of gold that might be hiding in there!
