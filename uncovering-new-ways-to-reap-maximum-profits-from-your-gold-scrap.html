<meta name="description" content="The secret to an impressive gold scraping finish is all in the technique. It requires skill and patience, but if done correctly it can look stunning! First you have to decide what material you are using for your scrape; leather, wood or metal? (It's important not to mix them). Then, prepare the surface by sanding or smoothing it with a polishing tool. After that, select the type of scraper you will use â€“ a stiff brush or a soft cloth.">
