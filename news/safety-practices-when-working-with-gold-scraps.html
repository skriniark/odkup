                      <h4>Understand the Properties of Gold </h4><br><p>Gold is a precious metal with many desirable properties, yet it can be dangerous when working with scrap. (It) is important to understand the characteristics of gold to stay safe in the workplace. First and foremost, gold is malleable and ductile, meaning it can be hammered or drawn out into thin wires without breaking. Additionally, it has excellent electrical conductivity and heat resistance. It also does not corrode or tarnish like other metals. <br />
<br />
Yet, despite these useful properties, gold scraps can still pose a safety risk! They may contain impurities such as copper or zinc that could cause allergies or skin irritations. Furthermore, due to its high value, gold scraps are often targeted by thieves so proper security measures should be taken to protect them. (This) includes using secure lock boxes and alarms when storing them away from the worksite.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, workers should always wear protective gear when handling gold scraps - such as gloves and eye protection - as they might contain sharp edges or small particles that could potentially harm you if inhaled or come into contact with your skin! In additionaal, always ensure that any hazardous materials resulting from working with gold scraps are properly disposed of in accordance with local regulations. <br />
<br />
