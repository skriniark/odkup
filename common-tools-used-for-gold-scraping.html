<meta name="description" content="Achieving an impressive gold scraping finish is no easy task. It requires (patience, effort and a lot of trial and error!) But once you've got the hang of it, there are some key steps to take in order to get that perfect look. Firstly, use a very fine sandpaper - this will help smooth out any small imperfections. Secondly, make sure to apply plenty of polish to the surface - this will help to seal the gold from dirt or moisture. Finally, use a soft brush or cloth to buff the surface - this will bring out its natural sheen!">
